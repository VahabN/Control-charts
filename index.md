#### What is a monitoring chart? 
  ##### These kinds of charts are used in process monitoring to find and detect changes over time. Control charts usually have 3 main components:
   ###### Centerline: Could be mean of the data points that we are monitoring or could be a target value based on the problem specification. 
   ###### Upper control limit: Horizontal line that shows the upper boundary of the in-control process.
   ###### Lower control limit: Horizontal line that shows the upper boundary of the in-control process.
